class PolicyRolloutWrapper:
    """Use this wrapper around a policy that you plan to roll out in an environment.

    This wrapper bridges the gap between the world of policies where we use the RL formalism, and real world
    environments where time may be a factor. It may still be used on synchronous simulation environments.

    The policy is designed to take in a sequence of s observations ending at some time-step n and return a
    sequence of h actions starting from that timestep n. Formally:

    a_{n:n+h-1} = Ï€(o_{n-s+1:n})

    This wrapper manages observations in a cache according to their timestamps in order to give the policy the
    correct inputs for the desired action timestamps.

    When running in synchronous simulation environments, the logic reduces to simply:

    1. Run inference synchronously to get a sequence of actions. Return the first action.
    2. Keep returning actions from the previously generated sequence.
    3. When the sequence is depleted, go back to 1.

    When simulating real-time or running in the real world, the logic does something more like:

    1. Run inference synchronously to get a sequence of actions. Return the first action.
    2. Keep returning actions from the previously generated sequence.
    3. When the sequence has <= n_action_buffer actions in it, run asynchronous inference. In the meantime go
       back to 2.

    The implementation details are more involved and are documented inline. The main point though is that we
    can set n_action_buffer to be just large enough such that before we run out of actions, we already have a
    new sequence ready.

        This method does several things:
        1. Accepts an observation with a timestamp. This is added to the observation cache.
        2. Runs inference either synchronously or asynchronously.
        3. Returns a sequence of actions starting from the requested timestamp (from a cache which is
           populated by inference outputs).

        If `timeout` is not provided, inference is run synchronously. If `timeout` is provided, inference runs
        asynchronously, and the function aims to return either an action sequence or None within the timeout
        period. It is guaranteed that if the timeout is not honored, a RuntimeError is raised (TODO(now)).

                as possible to the time at which the observation was captured.
